# GARDEN-MANAGER - backend

Prototype of garden-manager backend. Currently a basic java Rest entrypoint, but will be migrated to something lighter (the idea is to deploy this backend stack on a RaspberryPi)

Use only to check connectivity. For now, works well with DHT11 based prototype with 1 Lora gateway and 2 Lora nodes with DHT11 sensor. Backend receive continuous flow of temp / humidity values, with their corresponding node id
